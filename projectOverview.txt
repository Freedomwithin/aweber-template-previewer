I have  developed a React application inspired by AWeber's features, focusing on email template previewing and customer management. The project demonstrates several key technologies and concepts:

React with TypeScript:
The application is built using React and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

Tailwind CSS:
Used for styling and layout, providing a responsive and visually appealing UI.

Material-UI:
Utilized for UI components like dropdowns and buttons, enhancing user interaction.

React Query:
Implemented for fetching data from a mock API, handling caching and state management efficiently.

Mock API with json-server:
Created a local mock API using json-server to simulate backend data fetching.

Virtualized Lists:
Used react-window to efficiently render a large list of customers, improving performance.

Modular Structure:
Organized the code into separate components (TemplateSelector, TemplatePreview, CustomerList) for better maintainability.

Key Features:

Email Template Previewer:
Users can select and preview different email templates.
Templates are fetched from a mock API.

Customer List:
Displays a list of 1000 fake customers efficiently using virtualization.
Customers are generated using Faker.
Form Submission:
Simulates submitting a selected template to a backend endpoint.
Notifications:
Displays success or error notifications upon form submission.

Technologies Used:
React
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Material-UI
React Query
json-server (for mock API)
Faker (for generating fake customer data)
react-window (for virtualized lists)
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of modern frontend development practices and technologies, making it a great showcase for your skills.
